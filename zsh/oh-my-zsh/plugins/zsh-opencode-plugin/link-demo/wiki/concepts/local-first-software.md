# Local-first software

> **TLDR:** Local-first software keeps user data on disk in formats the user can inspect, back up, and move.

## Overview

Local-first software is a product design choice where the user's data remains directly accessible on their machine. In the demo sources, this matters because [[agent-memory]] can contain project decisions and source notes. *Source: [[agent-memory-session]]* `[confidence: high]`

Link follows this model by storing raw sources and wiki pages as markdown files. The graph and MCP server read those files rather than sending them to a hosted backend. *Source: [[local-release-notes]]* `[confidence: high]`

## Key Facts

- **Raw notes stay immutable** while generated wiki pages evolve. *Source: [[agent-memory-session]]* `[confidence: high]`
- **Local markdown keeps memory inspectable.** *Source: [[local-release-notes]]* `[confidence: high]`
